I Have Passed Phase 2! What Next?
In phases 1 and 2, all accounts are simulated to mimic actual market conditions. This means you will trade on a demo account.
Once you have been funded your account will be connected to a live trading account with an STP broker where you will trade with real capital. This is where you can earn an 80% profit share with the option to scale and reach an account balance of $5 million.
